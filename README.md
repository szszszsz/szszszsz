### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Szczepan from  Warsaw, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º. I collaborate with Nitrokey to develop open-source products that prioritize user data privacy and security, ensuring verifiability in their functionality.

I have a diverse range of skills as a versatile professional. My expertise spans across various areas, including embedded hardware firmware development, developing user-friendly graphical and command-line applications for PCs, conducting comprehensive QA testing, and thorough security reviews. In addition, I have successfully built LLMs in the past, managed data collection processes for them, engaged in full-stack web development projects, and even accomplished the implementation of my very own object detection system utilizing GPGPU/OpenCL technology. I am proficient in a wide array of programming languages such as Rust, Python, C, C++, Typescript, and Javascript.

- ðŸ”­ I'm actively involved in the development of [Nitrokey WebCrypt](https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-webcrypt), an ambitious solution designed to harness user-owned hardware-backed private keys within web applications. Our primary objective is to seamlessly integrate this functionality without requiring any additional setup on the user's end, making it compatible across various configurations where web browsers are employed, including mobile devices utilizing NFC technology. We warmly welcome any assistance and opportunities for collaboration in this endeavor.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about USB security devices, embedded firmware and testing.
